	<h1 id="header-001">What is Game Theory?</h1>
	<p>
		In essence, game theory is the study of how to model interactions between multiple individuals.
		Each individual in the game has a list of actions they can take in the game, and each individual has a level of satisfaction with the outcome.
		In some cases, an individual is only interested in their own satisfaction, so they may choose an action that makes other individuals less satisfied if it gets them the most satisfaction.
		Other times, individuals will be interested in the collective satisfaction, so they may choose an action that means slightly less satisfaction for themselves but ensures the others are satisfied as well.
		That may not make a lot of sense, so why don't I give you an example.
	</p>

		This game is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma"target="_blank">Prisoner's Dilemma</a> and is one of the most studied games in game theory.
		Two members of a gang have been arrested and are set to go on trial.
		The prosecutors have enough evidence to convict both of the prisoners on a minor charge, but they suspect the prisoners committed a larger crime.
		Both prisoners are separated and interrogated, given the choice to either "confess" or "deny" their involvement in the larger crime.
		If both prisoners confess, they each serve two years in prison.
		If only one prisoner confesses and the other denies, the prisoner that confesses will get three years while the denier gets zero.
		And if both prisoners deny, both are sentenced one year each on just the minor charges.
		This can be represented by this table:
	</p>
	<center>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td></td>
				<td>Confess</td>
				<td>Deny</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Confess</td>
				<td>-1, -1</td>
				<td>-3, 0</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Deny</td>
				<td>0, -3</td>
				<td>-2, -2</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</center>
	<p>
		Now what can we observe from this?
		For starters, we can all agree that both prisoners denying would objectively be the worst outcome.
		At the same time, we know that if both prisoners were playing in their own interest, both of them would end up choosing to deny.
		So why is that?
	</p>
	<p>
		Think about it like this.
		No matter what prisoner one chooses, prisoner two has no idea what was chosen and will always have the same choices.
		If prisoner one confesses, then prisoner two gets a payoff of -1 if they confess and 0 if they deny.
		If prisoner one denies, prisoner two gets a payoff of -3 if they confess and -2 if they deny.
		Regardless of what prisoner one chooses to do, we see that denying gets a better payoff for prisoner two.
		Similarly, prisoner one knows that no matter what prisoner two does, denying nets a better result for prisoner one.
		This is what makes this game a "dilemma."
		The mathematically best outcome is both prisoners confessing, but the mathematically best strategy is both prisoners denying.
		This is just one of many fascinating games covered in game theory.
